# Tables


Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) and Markdown Here supports them. 

Exemple :

    | Tables        | Are             | Cool |
    | ------------- |:---------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned   | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |


| Tables        | Are             | Cools |
| ------------- |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned   | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |


Colons can be used to align columns.

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Exemple:

    Markdown | Less | Pretty
    --- | --- | ---
    *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** 
    1 | 2 | 3

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---

1 | 2 | 3
